## Testing

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. To run the tests:

```bash
bun run test
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```bash
bun run test -- --watch
```

Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

---

## Code Style

We follow strict coding standards enforced by Prettier and ESLint.

- Run `bun run lint` to check for linting issues.
- Run `bun run lint:fix` to automatically fix issues.
- Run `bun run format` to format the codebase.

Before submitting your changes, ensure your code passes linting and formatting checks.
